# DreamPearl
A procedural system to build randomized worlds based on physically sound principles, but with story motivated guidance and shaping.

Highlights: Non-polar mesh built from decomposed D20, barnes-hutt location LOD lookup, computational fluid dynamics simulation for the plates.
Working On: 3D fluid dynamics sim of atmosphere movement and water cycle
Future: basic navigation as sprite character on surface, basic quest paths and sites, flora/fauna creation

Coded on my phone using the AIDE IDE and meant for deployment to that platform.

However, uses OpenGL ES2 for all rendering, and can be fairly easily ported except for highly Android specific sextions like MainActivity, which is the starting point for the program.

May also serve as instructional for setting OpenGl rendering on Android.
